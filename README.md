## Setup
requirements.txt is included


## Usage
Launch the application using python and drag and drop the image that you need to convert.


## Project Status
Project is: _no longer being worked on_ because it does what i need it to do and that's all it was made for rather than publishing it for production.


## Room for Improvement
Room for improvement:
- Make it prettier
- Check if the files are an "image type" or not
- Choose which file type to change to, maybe a field where you type the format
- Fix the "Ugly code" where the conversion happens
- Add documentation
